## 🚀 Features

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 _PvP Mode_ – Classic 2-player mode, but spiced up with transitions and responsive UI.

  - _Easy_: The bot is dumber than your old Nokia.
  - _Medium_: Bot thinks one step ahead like a decent player.
  - *Hard: Built with **Minimax Algorithm, this bot plays **perfectly. You can only *draw it, never beat it.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🕹 Modes

- On launch, select a game mode:
  - PvP: Pick who starts and begin.
  - Bot: Select difficulty → choose to play as X or O.

### 🧠 AI Logic

- _Medium Bot_: Uses getBestMove() to try winning or blocking one move ahead.
- _Hard Bot: Uses recursive \*\*Minimax_ algorithm to evaluate all possible outcomes. It never makes a mistake.

### 🔄 Reset Behavior

- Reset clears the board, sounds, and reinitializes game logic.
- If it's the bot’s turn after reset, it will auto-move after a 1s delay.
